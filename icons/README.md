# Placeholder Icon Files

This directory contains the icon files for the Social Media Detox Timer Chrome extension.

For a real extension, you would need:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels) - Used in the extension management page
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) - Used in the extension management page and notifications
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels) - Used in the Chrome Web Store and extension management

To create actual icons:
1. Design a 128x128 pixel icon representing a timer or clock
2. Use tools like GIMP, Photoshop, or online icon generators
3. Export in PNG format at the required sizes
4. Ensure the icons are clear and recognizable at small sizes

Suggested icon concepts:
- ‚è±Ô∏è Timer with social media symbols
- üéØ Target with time elements
- üì± Phone with clock overlay
- üßò Zen/mindfulness theme
- üå± Growth/habit building theme

For now, Chrome will use a default extension icon during development.
